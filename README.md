# OddJobs

01/11/2022 - This is a team based project I did with three other memebers. This project uses Heroku for database mechanics and those will need to be updated before used again.


WebAPI requires .env file with GCP_PATH set to path to authentication key like:
GCP_PATH = '[PATH]'
GBQ_DATABASE = '[DATABASE]'

Steps to create venv:
py -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
